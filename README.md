Loom Slide Deck!
================

This is a slide deck application written in Loom

Code originally created by Ben Garney of the Engine Company
Refactoring and Refinement by Joshua Evans of Level 4 Development

## How to create slides
To create slides, first instantiate ImageElements and TextElements and add them to a Slide instance. Once the slide is created it can be added
to the slide deck. The internal mechanics will handle the rest!

Check out the in line documentation in each file (espeically the examples in the main application file) for more tricks!
